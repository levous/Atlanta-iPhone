Running my presentation code...

Most of my presentation code will utilize google-toolbox-for-mac  
currently version 1.5.1

You can find the source here: http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/
checkout the code by navigating to the root of my presentations folder, where this read me is located, and execute the following using Terminal:
svn checkout http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ google-toolbox-for-mac-1-5-1

(there is a space after the last slash)

I do NOT recommend you build other projects from this directory as its a silly name and not very resilient.  
My expectation is that you'll use this code as reference, in its own sandbox, and then dump it.  I spent no time trying to use a good directory structure, decent application architecture or even respectable coding practices :)
